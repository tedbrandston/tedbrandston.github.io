&lt;p&gt;A while back I read about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar"&gt;biochar&lt;/a&gt;. I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/"&gt;HOPE 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk"&gt;solarpunk&lt;/a&gt; feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
