&lt;p>A while back I read about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar">biochar&lt;/a>. I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/">HOPE 2020&lt;/a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk&lt;/a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/">this article&lt;/a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
