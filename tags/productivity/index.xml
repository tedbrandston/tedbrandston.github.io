I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure that productivity is the right word for what I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with: some mix of organization, choosing what to work on, finding time to work on it, and then working on the thing that I intended to work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with both in work context and in a personal context, but recently I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve made some significant changes &amp;ndash; and one in particular &amp;ndash; that have really improved my ability to get things done at work (I&amp;rsquo;m still working on bringing this to my personal time). I might touch on some of the others, but the biggest improvement seems to come from planning out what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do at the beginning of each day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
