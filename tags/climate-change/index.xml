I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/">HOPE 2020&lt;/a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk&lt;/a> feels associated with this).

(I should note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed. I know, I know, I know &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m part of the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
