&lt;p>A while back I read about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar">biochar&lt;/a>. I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/">HOPE 2020&lt;/a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk&lt;/a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/">this article&lt;/a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Eco Friendly</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing about &lt;a href="https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home.md">a solar biochar kiln&lt;/a> left me thinking a lot about how to define &amp;ldquo;eco friendly&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been thinking about it in relation to some news a friend pointed me at: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/to-tote-or-note-to-tote/498557/">canvas&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/style/cotton-totes-climate-crisis.html">bags&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1585027/when-it-comes-to-climate-change-cotton-totes-might-be-worse-than-plastic/">are&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/01/22/is-your-reusable-tote-worse-for-the-environment-than-a-plastic-bag">worse&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/sustainable-living/cotton-tote-bags-sustainable-shopping-b1909035.html">than&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.rateitgreen.com/green-building-community/discussions/plastic-vs-reusable-bags-which-bag-is-best/1340">plastic&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/579437/cotton-canvas-tote-bad-for-environment">bags&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hFgtIziShmc">Poor Tim Minchin&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I should note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed. I know, I know, I know &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m part of the problem. They also mostly cite the same couple of studies. I might try to write more about that later&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
