It's late.

You ate dinner and put the kids to bed 3 hours ago, and now it's almost bedtime but you're hungry again.

1. Take a slice of bread
2. Slather it with unsweetened peanut butter
3. Pour a generous quantity of hot smoked paprika OR grind a generous quantity of black pepper onto the peanut butter
4. Enjoy!
