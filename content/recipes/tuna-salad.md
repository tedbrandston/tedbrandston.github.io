Ingredients:
* 1 can tuna in water
* 1 can sardines in olive oil
* Carrot, diced very small
* Celery, diced very small
* One small shallot, diced even smaller
* Capers in brine, some of which should be coarsely chopped
* Mayonnaise
* Dijon mustard

Preparation:
1. Put tuna in a mixing bowl, reserving the water
2. Add sardines, reserving the oil
3. Add however much of the other ingredients you'd like. I generally start with:
  * about a third of a cup each celery and carrot
  * About a quarter cup of shallot
  * About three tablespoons chopped capers, and another tablespoon whole
  * A tablespoon each mayonnaise and mustard. I always add mayonnaise and mustard in equal amounts.
4. Taste and adjust, adding more of whatever seems to be missing. Adding tuna water and sardine oil can adjust the texture and boost that fishy flavor.

Eat immediately. This lasts reasonably well for about a day in the fridge, but after that the shallot gets too strong and the flavor of the capers dulls. It'll still be edible, but much less enjoyable.
