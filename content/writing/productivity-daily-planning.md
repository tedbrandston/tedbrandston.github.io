productivity is something that I care about, and also something that they have struggled with. I'm not even sure their productivity is the right word for what I've struggle with: some mix of organization, choosing what to work on, finding time to work on it, and then working on the thing that I intended to work on.

it's something I have struggled with both in work context and in a personal context, but recently I feel like I've made some significant changes -- and one in particular -- that have really improved my ability to get things done at work (I'm still working on bringing this to my personal time). I might touch on some of the others, but the biggest improvement seems to come from planning out what I'm going to do at the beginning of each day.

historically I have not had much confidence in the work that I do, nor felt sure that I was working on the right thing. many of my days have been bogged down in feeling like I wasn't working on the thing I really needed to do, or like I was dancing around doing the thing I needed to, avoiding it. I would sometimes have days where I got lots of little things done but not the larger thing that would require me to focus for an hour. there was also a lot of time spent after I finished in a given task thinking "okay, what do I feel up to doing now?"

I've started taking 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of each work day to type up a rough set of things I can probably finish *that day*, and it has helped with basically all of the above problems.

it's not the full solution to all of the above problems:
* I had to do a decent amount of work around how I felt starting new/uncertain tasks.
* had to switch from tracking an ongoing and ever growing list of to-do items to keeping a list of things I could do
* I've stopped treating the thing about how it takes you 15 minutes to recover full focus after an interruption and a rule, or as an excuse not to work on something if they only have a few minutes left

still, since I started daily planning I spend almost no time dithering, wondering what to work on. I mostly work on the most important thing (I say mostly because I think that sometimes it's important to go with where your focus is drawing your attention, rather than always fighting it).
