I've never heard of a performance review system that people really liked. I think the highest praise I've heard for one is "it doesn't get in the way." Why is that?

We can start by asking "what is a performance review system trying to solve?"

### One process to rule them all.
I think there are a lot of things performance reviews try to solve:
* helping people who are doing well feel appreciated.
* helping people who aren't doing as well as they "should be" understand that they need to do better.
* clarifying what specific projects/tasks/etc. are expected from people.
* evaluating people for raises/promotions/firing.
* pushing managers to regularly address the above with folks they manage, because it's basically never enjoyable to talk to someone in detail about what they're doing well or poorly, especially when it gets tied up with compensation/title/job security.
* generally avoiding people feeling "surprised".

That's... a lot of things to try to solve all at once, and they often get in the way of each other. People I see as doing really well are generally not just doing the specific projects that are expected of them, they're looking around and finding ways to pitch in outside their expectations and they don't really need their core work explicitly enumerated and forcing them to do a useless process that ignores their competence doesn't leave them feeling appreciated. Managers can feel pressure to adjust their evaluation of folks who report to them to support a raise or avoid a firing, which reduces the utility of the feedback (unless additional feedback is given out-of-band) and undermines the validity of/trust in the evaluation process.

How could we change this, so that these conflicts are removed? Could we set things up differently, maybe with multiple processes instead of just one, such that all these problems still get solved?

I'm not sure.

### Can we ditch raises and titles?
My first thought is "break the tie between performance and raises". If people don't feel like money is on the line, a major source of tension is removed (though some of us feel tense about being evaluated at all).

This doesn't fix the tension around firings, but let's ignore that for now.

Rather than periodically deciding which people are doing well enough that they can be given raises, we could give standard, across-the-board raises. These could be based on cost-of-living or an index of the job market.
