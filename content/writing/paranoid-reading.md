# Paranoid Reading

A while back I read the first bunch of pages of an essay titled 
"Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading". I think I probably only 
half-understood what of it I read, but even in that little chunk there was an
idea (what I believe to be the core idea of the essay) that seemed really
interesting to me: that nowadays we default to reading things in the worst
light it's probably not good.

I kept meaning to go back and read the rest of the essay, but what I had read
was a challenge to get through, and I wasn't sure I had really gotten all of
what was said in the early part. I don't remember when or why, but at some point
this intersected in my head with a long-time idea that I've had about finding
ways to automatically translate dense, [jargon](/writing/words.md)-filled writing into
layperson's terms: What if I, in stages, revised the essay down into something
easier to read but still fairly true to the original?

So, I'm going to take a stab at it. 

Below is a poorly-formatted rip of [a pdf of the essay]. I'm not totally sure
how I'm going to do this, but my gut tells me going paragraph-by-paragraph in a
table that I can expand out for each revision is a reasonable and clear way to
do it. I'm not totally sure what changes need to be made, but I'm assuming:
* Reducing "complex words"/jargon like "hermenutics" (it's been a decade since
  I was introduced to that word and I still have trouble holding the concept in
  my head while I read) and epistemology.
* Reducing/expanding out references to other philosophers? I feel like this was
  part of where I got lost when reading it.
* Other stuff?

Sometime back in the middle of the first decade of the aids epidemic, I
was picking the brains of a friend of mine, the activist scholar Cindy Pat-
ton, about the probable natural history of HIV. This was at a time when
speculation was ubiquitous about whether the virus had been deliberately
engineered or spread, whether HIV represented a plot or experiment by the
U.S. military that had gotten out of control, or perhaps that was behaving
exactly as it was meant to. After hearing a lot from her about the geography
and economics of the global traffic in blood products, I finally, with some
eagerness, asked Patton what she thought of these sinister rumors about
the virus’s origin. "Any of the early steps in its spread could have been either
accidental or deliberate," she said. "But I just have trouble getting interested
in that. I mean, even suppose we were sure of every element of a conspiracy:
that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of
the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they
aren’t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill
noncombatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly
on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes.
Supposing we were ever so sure of all those things—what would we know
then that we don’t already know?"

In the years since that conversation, I’ve brooded a lot over this response of 
Patton’s. Aside from a certain congenial, stony pessimism, I think what
I’ve found enabling about it is that it suggests the possibility of unpacking,
of disentangling from their impacted and overdetermined historical relation
to each other some of the separate elements of the intellectual baggage that
many of us carry around under a label such as "the hermeneutics
of suspicion." Patton’s comment suggests that for someone to have an un-
mystified, angry view of large and genuinely systemic oppressions does not
intrinsically or necessarily enjoin that person to any specific train of episte-
mological or narrative consequences. To know that the origin or spread of
HIV realistically might have resulted from a state-assisted conspiracy—such
knowledge is, it turns out, separable from the question of whether the ener-
gies of a given aids activist intellectual or group might best be used in the
tracing and exposure of such a possible plot. They might, but then again,
theymightnot.Though ethically very fraught, thechoice is notself-evident;
whether or not to undertake this highly compelling tracing-and-exposure
project represents a strategic and local decision, not necessarily a categori-
cal imperative. Patton’s response to me seemed to open a space for moving
from the rather fixated question Is a particular piece of knowledge true, and
how can we know? to the further questions: What does knowledge do—the
pursuit of it, the having and exposing of it, the receiving again of knowl-
edge of what one already knows? How, in short, is knowledge performative,
and how best does one move among its causes and effects?

I suppose this ought to seem quite an unremarkable epiphany: that
knowledge does rather than simply is it is by now very routine to discover.
Yet it seems that a lot of the real force of such discoveries has been blunted
through the habitual practices of the same forms of critical theory that
have given such broad currency to the formulae themselves. In particu-
lar, it is possible that the very productive critical habits embodied in what
Paul Ricoeur memorably called the "hermeneutics of suspicion"—wide-
spread critical habits indeed, perhaps by now nearly synonymous with
criticism itself—may have had an unintentionally stultifying side effect:
they may have made it less rather than more possible to unpack the local,
contingent relations between any given piece of knowledge and its narra-
tive/epistemological entailments for the seeker, knower, or teller.

Ricoeur introduced the category of the hermeneutics of suspicion to
describe the position of Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and their intellectual off-
spring in a context that also included such alternative disciplinary herme-
neutics as the philological and theological "hermeneutics of recovery of
meaning." His intent in offering the former of these formulations was de-
scriptive and taxonomic rather than imperative. In the context of recent U.S.
critical theory, however, where Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud by themselves
are taken as constituting a pretty sufficient genealogy for the mainstream of
New Historicist, deconstructive, feminist, queer, and psychoanalytic criti-
cism, to applya hermeneutics of suspicion is, I believe, widelyunderstood as
a mandatory injunction rather than a possibility among other possibilities.
The phrase now has something like the sacred status of Fredric Jameson’s
"Always historicize"—and, like that one, it fits oddly into its new position in
the tablets of the Law. Always historicize? What could have less to do with
historicizing than the commanding, atemporal adverb "always"? It reminds
me of the bumper stickers that instruct people in other cars to "Question
Authority." Excellent advice, perhaps wasted on anyone who does what-
ever they’re ordered to do by a strip of paper glued to an automobile! The
imperative framing will do funny things to a hermeneutics of suspicion.
Not surprisingly, the methodological centrality of suspicion to cur-
rent critical practice has involved a concomitant privileging of the con-
cept of paranoia. In the last paragraphs of Freud’s essay on the paranoid
Dr. Schreber, there is discussion of what Freud considers a "striking simi-
larity" between Schreber’s systematic persecutory delusion and Freud’s
own theory. Freud was indeed later to generalize, famously, that "the delu-
sions of paranoiacs have an unpalatable external similarity and internal
kinship to the systems of our philosophers"—among whom he included
himself (12:79, 17:271). For all his slyness, it may be true that the putative
congruence between paranoia and theory was unpalatable to Freud; if so,
however, it is no longer viewed as unpalatable. The articulation of such a
congruence may have been inevitable, at any rate; as Ricoeur notes, "For
Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, the fundamental category of consciousness is
the relation hidden-shown or, if you prefer, simulated-manifested....Thus
the distinguishing characteristic of Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche is the gen-
eral hypothesis concerning both the process of false consciousness and the
method of deciphering. The two go together, since the man of suspicion
carries out in reverse the work of falsification of the man of guile" (33–34).
The man of suspicion double-bluffing the man of guile: in the hands of
thinkers after Freud, paranoia has by now candidly become less a diagno-
sis than a prescription. In a world where no one need be delusional to find
evidence of systemic oppression, to theorize out of anything but a paranoid
critical stance has come to seem naïve, pious, or complaisant. I myself have
no wish to return to the use of "paranoid" as a pathologizing diagnosis,
but it seems to me a great loss when paranoid inquiry comes to seem en-
tirely coextensive with critical theoretical inquiry rather than being viewed
as one kind of cognitive/affective theoretical practice among other, alter-
native kinds.

Even aside from the prestige that now attaches to a hermeneutics of
suspicion in critical theory as a whole, queer studies in particular has had
a distinctive history of intimacy with the paranoid imperative. Freud, of
course, traced every instance of paranoia to the repression of specifically
same-sex desire, whether in women or in men. The traditional, homopho-
bic psychoanalytic use that has generally been made of Freud’s associa-
tion has been to pathologize homosexuals as paranoid or to consider para-
noia a distinctively homosexual disease. In Homosexual Desire, however, a
1972 book translated into English in 1978, Guy Hocquenghem returned to
Freud’s formulations to draw from them a conclusion that would not repro-
duce this damaging non sequitur. If paranoia reﬂects the repression of same-
sex desire, Hocquenghem reasoned, then paranoia is a uniquely privileged
site for illuminating not homosexuality itself, as in the Freudian tradition,
but rather precisely the mechanisms of homophobic and heterosexist en-
forcement against it. What is illuminated by an understanding of paranoia
is not how homosexuality works, but how homophobia and heterosexism
work—in short, if one understands these oppressions to be systemic, how
the world works.

Paranoia thus became by the mid-1980s a privileged object of antihomo-
phobic theory. How did it spread so quickly from that status to being its
uniquely sanctioned methodology? I have been looking back into my own
writing of the 1980s as well as that of some other critics, trying to retrace
that transition—one that seems worthy of remark now but seemed at the
time, I think, the most natural move in the world. Part of the explanation
lies in a property of paranoia itself. Simply put, paranoia tends to be conta-
gious; more specifically, paranoia is drawn toward and tends to construct
symmetrical relations, in particular, symmetrical epistemologies. As Leo
Bersani writes, "To inspire interest is to be guaranteed a paranoid reading,
just as we must inevitably be suspicious of the interpretations we inspire.
Paranoia is an inescapable interpretive doubling of presence" (188). It sets
a thief (and, if necessary, becomes one) to catch a thief; it mobilizes guile
against suspicion, suspicion against guile; "it takes one to know one." A
paranoid friend, who believes I am reading her mind, knows this from read-
ing mine; also a suspicious writer, she is always turning up at crime scenes
of plagiarism, indifferently as perpetrator or as victim; a litigious colleague
as well, she not only imagines me to be as familiar with the laws of libel
as she is, but eventually makes me become so. (All these examples, by the
way, are fictitious.)
Given that paranoia seems to have a peculiarly intimate relation to the
phobic dynamics around homosexuality, then, it may have been structur-
ally inevitable that the reading practices that became most available and
fruitful in antihomophobic work would often in turn have been paranoid
ones. There must have been historical as well as structural reasons for this
development, however, because it is less easy to account on structural terms
for the frequent privileging of paranoid methodologies in recent nonqueer
critical projects such as feminist theory, psychoanalytic theory, deconstruc-
tion, Marxist criticism, or the New Historicism. One recent discussion of
paranoia invokes "a popular maxim of the late 1960s: ‘Just because you’re
paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you’ " (Adams 15). In fact, it
seems quite plausible that someversion of this axiom (perhaps "Evena para-
noid can have enemies," uttered by Henry Kissinger) is so indelibly inscribed
in the brains of baby boomers that it offers us the continuing illusion of pos-
sessing a special insight into the epistemologies of enmity. My impression,
again, is that we are liable to produce this constative formulation as fiercely
as if it had a self-evident imperative force: the notation that even paranoid
people have enemies is wielded as if its absolutely necessary corollary were
the injunction "so you can never be paranoid enough."
But the truth value of the original axiom, assuming it to be true, doesn’t
actually make a paranoid imperative self-evident. Learning that "just be-
cause you’re paranoid doesn’t mean you don’t have enemies," somebody
might deduce that being paranoid is not an effective way to get rid of ene-
mies. Rather than concluding "so you can never be paranoid enough," this
person might instead be moved to reﬂect "but then, just because you have
enemies doesn’t mean you have to be paranoid." That is to say, once again:
for someone to have an unmystified view of systemic oppressions does not
intrinsicallyor necessarilyenjoin that person to any specifictrainof epistemo-
logical or narrative consequences.To be other than paranoid (and of course,
we’ll need to define this term much more carefully), to practice other than
paranoid forms of knowing does not, in itself, entail a denial of the reality
or gravity of enmity or oppression.

How are we to understand paranoia in such a way as to situate it as
one kind of epistemological practice among other, alternative ones? Be-
sides Freud’s, the most usable formulations for this purpose would seem
to be those of Melanie Klein and (to the extent that paranoia represents an
affective as well as cognitive mode) Silvan Tomkins. In Klein, I find particu-
larly congenial her use of the concept of positions—the schizoid/paranoid
position, the depressive position—as opposed to, for example, normatively
ordered stages, stable structures, or diagnostic personality types. As Hinshel-
wood writes in his Dictionary of Kleinian Thought, "The term ‘position’ de-
scribes the characteristic posture that the ego takes up with respect to its
objects....[Klein] wanted to convey, with the idea of position, a much
more ﬂexible to-and-fro process between one and the other than is nor-
mally meant by regression to fixation points in the developmental phases"
(394). The ﬂexible to-and-fro movement implicit in Kleinian positions will
be useful for my discussion of paranoid and reparative critical practices, not
as theoretical ideologies (and certainly not as stable personality types of
critics), but as changing and heterogeneous relational stances.

The greatest interest of Klein’s concept lies, it seems to me, in her seeing
the paranoid position always in the oscillatory context of a very different
possible one: the depressive position. For Klein’s infant or adult, the para-
noid position—understandably marked by hatred, envy, and anxiety—is a
position of terrible alertness to the dangers posed by the hateful and envi-
ous part-objects that one defensively projects into, carves out of, and in-
gests from the world around one. By contrast, the depressive position is
an anxiety-mitigating achievement that the infant or adult only sometimes,
and often only brieﬂy, succeeds in inhabiting: this is the position from which
it is possible in turn to use one’s own resources to assemble or "repair" the
murderous part-objects into something like a whole—though, I would em-
phasize, not necessarily like any preexisting whole. Once assembled to one’s
own specifications, the more satisfying object is available both to be identi-
fied with and to offer one nourishment and comfort in turn. Among Klein’s
names for the reparative process is love.

Giventhe instabilityand mutual inscription built into the Kleinian notion
of positions, I am also, in the present project, interested in doing justice to
the powerful reparative practices that, I am convinced, infuse self-avowedly
paranoid critical projects, as well as in the paranoid exigencies that are often
necessary for nonparanoid knowing and utterance. For example, Patton’s
calm response to me about the origins of HIV drew on a lot of research,
her own and other people’s, much of which required being paranoiacally
structured.
For convenience’s sake, I borrow my critical examples as I proceed from
two inﬂuential studies of the past decade, one roughly psychoanalytic and
the other roughly New Historicist—but I do so for more than the sake of
convenience, as both are books ( Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble and D. A.
Miller’s The Novel and the Police) whose centrality to the development of my
own thought, and that of the critical movements that most interest me, are
examples of their remarkable force and exemplarity. Each, as well, is inter-
estingly located in a tacit or ostensibly marginal, but in hindsight originary
and authorizing relation to different strains of queer theory. Finally, I draw
a sense of permission from the fact that neither book is any longer very rep-
resentative of the most recent work of either author, so that observations
about the reading practices of either book may, I hope, escape being glued
as if allegorically to the name of the author.
I would like to begin by setting outside the scope of this discussion
any overlap between paranoia per se on the one hand, and on the other
hand the states variously called dementia praecox (by Kraepelin), schizo-
phrenia (by Bleuler), or, more generally, delusionality or psychosis. As La-
planche and Pontalis note, the history of psychiatry has attempted various
mappings of this overlap: "Kraepelin differentiates clearly between para-
noia on the one hand and the paranoid form of dementia praecox on the
other; Bleuler treats paranoia as a sub-category of dementia praecox, or
the group of schizophrenias; as for Freud, he is quite prepared to see cer-
tain so-called paranoid forms of dementia praecox brought under the head
of paranoia....[Forexample, Schreber’s] case of ‘paranoid dementia’ is
essentially a paranoia proper [and therefore not a form of schizophrenia] in
Freud’s eyes" (297). In Klein’s later writings, meanwhile, the occurrence of
psychoticlike mental events is seen as universal in both children and adults,
so that mechanisms such as paranoia have a clear ontological priority over
diagnostic categories such as dementia. The reason I want to insist in ad-
vance on this move is, once again, to try to hypothetically disentangle the
question of truth value from the question of performative effect.

I am saying that the main reasons for questioning paranoid practices are
other than the possibility that their suspicions can be delusional or simply
wrong. Concomitantly, some of the main reasons for practicing paranoid
strategies may be other than the possibility that they offer unique access
to true knowledge. They represent a way, among other ways, of seeking,
finding, and organizing knowledge. Paranoia knows some things well and
others poorly.

I’d like to undertake now something like a composite sketch of what I
mean by paranoia in this connection—not as a tool of differential diagnosis,
but as a tool for better seeing differentials of practice. My main headings are:

Paranoia is anticipatory.
Paranoia is reﬂexive and mimetic.
Paranoia is a strong theory.
Paranoia is a theory of negative affects.
Paranoia places its faith in exposure.

paranoia is anticipatory
That paranoia is anticipatory is clear from every account and theory of the
phenomenon. The first imperative of paranoia is There must be no bad sur-
prises, and indeed, the aversion to surprise seems to be what cements the
intimacy between paranoiaand knowledgeper se, includingboth epistemo-
philia and skepticism. D. A. Miller notes in The Novel and the Police, "Sur-
prise...isprecisely what the paranoid seeks to eliminate, but it is also what,
in the event, he survives by reading as a frightening incentive: he can never
be paranoid enough" (164).

</td>

<tr>

The unidirectionally future-oriented vigilance of paranoia generates,
paradoxically, a complex relation to temporality that burrows both back-
ward and forward: because there must be no bad surprises, and because
learning of the possibility of a bad surprise would itself constitute a bad sur-
prise, paranoia requires that bad news be always already known. As Miller’s
analysis also suggests, the temporal progress and regress of paranoia are,
in principle, infinite. Hence perhaps, I suggest, Butler’s repeated and scour-
ingly thorough demonstrations in Gender Trouble that there can have been
no moment prior to the imposition of the totalizing Law of gender differ-
ence; hence her unresting vigilance for traces in other theorists’ writing of
nostalgia for such an impossible prior moment. No time could be too early
for one’s having-already-known, for its having-already-been-inevitable, that
something bad would happen. And no loss could be too far in the future to
need to be preemptively discounted.
paranoia is reflexive and mimetic
In noting, as I have already, the contagious tropism of paranoia toward
symmetrical epistemologies, I have relied on the double senses of paranoia
as reﬂexive and mimetic. Paranoia seems to require being imitated to be
understood, and it, in turn, seems to understand only by imitation. Para-
noia proposes both Anything you can do (to me) I can do worse, and Anything
you can do (to me) I can do first—to myself. In The Novel and the Police, Miller
is much more explicit than Freud in embracing the twin propositions that
one understandsparanoiaonly byoneself practicing paranoid knowing, and
that the way paranoia has of understanding anything is by imitating and
embodying it. That paranoia refuses to be only either a way of knowing or
a thing known, but is characterized by an insistent tropism toward occu-
pying both positions, is wittily dramatized from the opening page of this
definitive study of paranoia: a foreword titled "But Officer..."beginswith
an always-already-second-guessing sentence about how "Even the blandest
(or bluffest) ‘scholarly work’ fears getting into trouble," including trouble
"with the adversaries whose particular attacks it keeps busy anticipating"
(vii). As the book’s final paragraph notes about David Copperfield, Miller too
"everywhere intimatesa...pattern in which the subject constitutes him-
self ‘against’ discipline by assuming that discipline in his own name" (220)
or even his own body (191).

It seems no wonder, then, that paranoia, once the topic is broached in a
nondiagnostic context, seemsto grow like a crystal in ahypersaturated solu-
tion, blotting out any sense of the possibility of alternative ways of under-
standing or things to understand. I will say more later about some implica-
tions of the status of paranoia as, in this sense, inevitably a "strong theory."
What may be even more important is how severely the mimeticism of para-
noia circumscribes its potential as a medium of political or cultural struggle.
As I pointed out in a 1986 essay (in which my implicit reference was, as
it happens, to one of the essays later collected in The Novel and the Police),
"The problem here is not simply that paranoia is a form of love, for—in
a certain language—what is not? The problem is rather that, of all forms
of love, paranoia is the most ascetic, the love that demands least from its ob-
ject. . . . The gorgeous narrative work done by the Foucauldian paranoid,
transforming the simultaneous chaoses of institutions into a consecutive,
drop-dead-elegant diagram of spiralling escapes and recaptures, is also the
paranoid subject’s proffer of himself and his cognitive talent, now ready
for anything it can present in the way of blandishment or violence, to an
order-of-things morcelé that had until then lacked only narratibility, a body,
cognition" (Coherence xi).

At the risk of being awfully reductive, I suggest that this anticipatory, mi-
metic mechanism mayalso shed light on a striking feature of recent feminist
and queer uses of psychoanalysis. Lacan aside, few actual psychoanalysts
would dream of being as rigorously insistent as are manyoppositional theo-
rists—of whom Butler is very far from the most single-minded—in assert-
ing the inexorable, irreducible, uncircumnavigable, omnipresent centrality,
at every psychic juncture, of the facts (however factitious) of "sexual differ-
ence" and "the phallus." From such often tautological work, it would be
hard to learn that—from Freud onward, including, for example, the later
writings of Melanie Klein—the history of psychoanalytic thought offers
richly divergent, heterogeneous tools for thinking about aspects of person-
hood, consciousness, affect, filiation, social dynamics, and sexuality that,
though relevant to the experience of gender and queerness, are often not
centrally organized around "sexual difference" at all. Not that they are nec-
essarily prior to "sexual difference": they may simply be conceptualized as
somewhere to the side of it, tangentially or contingently related or even
rather unrelated to it.

Seemingly, the reservoir of such thought and speculation could make an
important resource for theorists committed to thinking about human lives
otherwise than through the prejudicious gender reifications that are com-
mon in psychoanalysis as in other projects of modern philosophy and sci-
ence. What has happened instead, I think, is something like the following.
First, through what might be called a process of vigilant scanning, femi-
nists and queers have rightly understood that no topic or area of psychoana-
lytic thought can be declared a priori immune to the inﬂuence of such gen-
der reifications. Second, however—and, it seems to me, unnecessarily and
often damagingly—the lack of such a priori immunity, the absence of any
guaranteed nonprejudicial point of beginning for feminist thought within
psychoanalysis has led to the widespread adoption by some thinkers of an
anticipatory mimetic strategy whereby a certain, stylized violence of sexual
differentiation must always be presumed or self-assumed—even, where nec-
essary, imposed—simply on the ground that it can never be finally ruled out.
(I don’t want to suggest, in using the word "mimetic," that these uses of
psychoanalytic gender categories need be either uncritical of or identical to
the originals. Butler, among others,has taught us a much less deadening use
of "mimetic.") But, forexample, in this post-Lacanian tradition, psychoana-
lytic thought that is not in the first place centrally organized around phallic
"sexual difference" must seemingly be translated, with however distorting
results, into that language before it can be put to any other theoretical use.
The contingent possibilities of thinking otherwise than through "sexual dif-
ference" are subordinated to the paranoid imperative that, if the violence of
such gender reification cannot be definitively halted in advance, it must at
least never arrive on any conceptual scene as a surprise. In a paranoid view,
it is more dangerous for such reification ever to be unanticipated than often
to be unchallenged.

paranoia is a strong theory
It is for reasons like these that, in the work of Silvan Tomkins, paranoia is
offeredas the example parexcellence of what Tomkins refers to as"strong af-
fect theory"—in this case, a strong humiliation or humiliation-fear theory.
As Chapter 3 explains, Tomkins’s use of the term "strong theory"—indeed,
his use of the term "theory" at all—has something of a double valence. He
goes beyond Freud’s reﬂection on possible similarities between, say, paranoia
and theory; byTomkins’s account, which is strongly marked byearly cyber-
netics’ interest in feedback processes, all people’s cognitive/affective lives
are organized according to alternative, changing, strategic, and hypotheti-
cal affect theories. As a result, there would be from the start no ontological
difference between the theorizingacts of a Freud and those of, say, one of his
analysands. Tomkins does not suggest that there is no metalevel of reﬂec-
tion in Freud’s theory, but that affect itself, ordinary affect, while irreducibly
corporeal, is also centrally shaped, through the feedback process, by its ac-
cess to just such theoretical metalevels. In Tomkins, there is no distance at
all between affect theory in the sense of the important explicit theorizing
some scientists and philosophers do around affects, and affect theory in the
sense of the largely tacit theorizing all people do in experiencing and trying
to deal with their own and others’ affects.

To call paranoia a strong theory is, then, at the same time to congratu-
late it as a big achievement (it’s a strong theory rather as, for Harold Bloom,
Milton is a strong poet) but also to classify it. It is one kind of affect theory
among other possible kinds, and by Tomkins’s account, a number of inter-
related affect theories of different kinds and strengths are likely to consti-
tute the mental life of any individual. Most pointedly, the contrast of strong
theory in Tomkins is with weak theory, and the contrast is not in every re-
spect to the advantage of the strong kind. The reach and reductiveness of
strong theory—that is, its conceptual economy or elegance—involve both
assets and deficits.What characterizes strong theory inTomkins is not, after
all, how well it avoids negative affect or finds positive affect, but the size and
topology of the domain that it organizes. "Any theory of wide generality,"
he writes,

> is capable of accounting for a wide spectrum of phenomena which appear
> to be very remote, one from the other, and from a common source. This is a
> commonly accepted criterion by which the explanatory power of any scien-
> tific theory can be evaluated. To the extent to which the theory can account
> only for "near" phenomena, it is a weak theory, little better than a descrip-
> tion of the phenomena which it purports to explain. As it orders more and
> more remote phenomena to a single formulation, its power grows....A
> humiliation theory is strong to the extent towhich it enables more and more
> experiences to be accounted for as instances of humiliating experiences on
> the one hand, orto theextent towhich it enables more and more anticipation

of such contingencies before they actually happen. (Affect 2:433–34)
As this account suggests, far from becoming stronger through obviating or
alleviating humiliation, a humiliation theory becomes stronger exactly in-
sofar as it fails to do so.Tomkins’s conclusion is not that all strong theory is
ineffective—indeed, it may grow to be only too effective—but that "affect
theory must be effective to be weak": "We can now see more clearly that al-
though a restrictedand weak theory maynot alwayssuccessfullyprotect the
individual against negative affect, it is difficult for it to remain weak unless
it does so. Conversely, a negative affect theory gains in strength, paradoxi-
cally, by virtue of the continuing failures of its strategies to afford protec-
tion through successful avoidance of the experience of negative affect....
It is the repeated and apparently uncontrollable spread of the experience of
negative affect which prompts the increasing strength of the ideo-affective
organization which we have called a strong affect theory" (2:323–24).
An affect theory is, among other things, a mode of selective scanning and
amplification; for this reason, any affect theory risks being somewhat tau-
tological, but because of its wide reach and rigorous exclusiveness, a strong
theory risks being strongly tautological:
> We have said that there is over-organization in monopolistic humiliation

This is how it happens that an explanatory structure that a reader may see as
tautological, in that it can’t help or can’t stop or can’t do anything other than
prove the very same assumptions with which it began, may be experienced
by the practitioner as a triumphant advance toward truth and vindication.
More usually, however, the roles in this drama are more mixed or more
widely distributed. I don’t suppose that too many readers—nor, for that
matter, perhaps the author—would be too surprised to hear it noted that
the main argument or strong theory of The Novel and the Police is entirely cir-
cular: everything can be understood as an aspect of the carceral, therefore
the carceral is everywhere. But who reads The Novel and the Police to find
out whether its main argument is true? In this case, as also frequently in the
case of the tautologies of "sexual difference," the very breadth of reach that
makes the theory strong also offers the space—of which Miller’s book takes
every advantage—for a wealth of tonal nuance, attitude, worldly observa-
tion, performative paradox, aggression, tenderness, wit, inventive reading,
obiter dicta, and writerly panache. These rewards are so local and frequent
that one might want to say that a plethora of only loosely related weak
theories has been invited to shelter in the hypertrophied embrace of the
book’s overarching strong theory. In many ways, such an arrangement is all
to the good—suggestive, pleasurable, and highly productive; an insistence
that everything means one thing somehow permits a sharpened sense of all
the ways there are of meaning it. But one need not read an infinite number
of students’ and other critics’ derivative rephrasings of the book’s grimly
strong theory to see, as well, some limitations of this unarticulated rela-
tion between strong and weak theories. As strong theory, and as a locus of
reﬂexive mimeticism, paranoia is nothing if not teachable. The powerfully
ranging and reductive forceof strong theory can make tautological thinking
hard to identify even as it makes it compelling and near inevitable; the result
is that both writers and readers can damagingly misrecognize whether and
where real conceptual work is getting done, and precisely what that work
might be.

paranoia is a theory of negative affects
While Tomkins distinguishes among a number of qualitatively different af-
fects, he also for some purposes groups affects together loosely as either
positive or negative. In these terms, paranoia is characterized not only by
being a strong theoryas opposed to aweakone, but by being a strong theory
of a negative affect. This proves important in terms of the overarching af-
fective goals Tomkins sees as potentially conﬂicting with each other in each
individual: he distinguishes in the first place between the general goal of
seeking to minimize negative affect and that of seeking to maximize posi-
tive affect. (The other, respectivelymoresophisticated goals heidentifies are
that affect inhibition be minimized and that the power to achieve the pre-
ceding three goals be maximized.) In most practices—in most lives—there
are small and subtle (though cumulatively powerful) negotiations between
and among these goals, but the mushrooming, self-confirming strength of
a monopolistic strategy of anticipating negative affect can have, according
to Tomkins, the effect of entirely blocking the potentially operative goal of
seeking positive affect. "The only sense in which [the paranoid] may strive
for positive affect at all is for the shield which it promises against humilia-
tion," he writes. "To take seriously the strategyof maximizing positive affect,
rather than simply enjoying it when the occasion arises, is entirely out of
the question" (Affect 2:458–59).

Similarly, in Klein’s writings from the 1940s and 1950s, it again represents
an actual achievement—a distinct, often risky positional shift—for an in-
fant or adult to move toward a sustained seeking of pleasure (through the
reparative strategies of the depressive position), rather than continue to pur-
sue the self-reinforcing because self-defeating strategies for forestalling pain
offered by the paranoid/schizoid position. It’s probably more usual for dis-
cussions of the depressive position in Klein to emphasize that that position
inaugurates ethical possibility—in the form of a guilty, empathetic view of
the other as at once good, damaged, integral, and requiring and eliciting
love and care. Such ethical possibility, however, is founded on and coexten-
sive with the subject’s movement toward what Foucault calls "care of the
self," the often very fragile concern to provide the self with pleasure and
nourishment in an environment that is perceived as not particularly offer-
ing them.

Klein’s and Tomkins’s conceptual moves here are more sophisticated
and, in an important way, less tendentious than the corresponding assump-
tions in Freud. To begin with, Freud subsumes pleasure seeking and pain
avoidance together under the rubric of the supposedly primordial "pleasure
principle," as though the two motives could not themselves radically differ.
1
Second, it is the pain-forestalling strategy alone in Freud that (as anxiety)
gets extended forward into the developmental achievement of the "reality
principle." This leavespleasure seeking as an alwayspresumable,unexamin-
able, inexhaustible underground wellspring of supposedly "natural" mo-
tive, one that presents only the question of how to keep its irrepressible
ebullitions under control. Perhaps even more problematically, this Freud-
ian schema silently installs the anxious paranoid imperative, the impossi-
bility but also the supposed necessity of forestalling pain and surprise, as
"reality"—as the only and inevitable mode, motive, content, and proof of
true knowledge.

In Freud, then, there would be no room—except as an example of self-
delusion—for the Proustian epistemology whereby the narrator of Àlare-
cherche, who feels in the last volume "jostling each other within me a whole
host of truths concerning human passions and character and conduct," rec-
ognizes them as truths insofar as "the perception of [them] caused me joy"
(6:303; emphasis added). In the paranoid Freudian epistemology, it is im-
plausible enough to suppose that truth could be even an accidental occasion
of joy, inconceivable to imagine joy as a guarantor of truth. Indeed, from
any point of view it is circular, or something, to suppose that one’s pleasure
at knowing something could be taken as evidence of the truth of the knowl-
edge. But a strong theory of positive affect, such as Proust’s narrator seems
to move toward in Time Regained, is no more tautological than the strong
theory of negative affect represented by, for example, his paranoia in The
Captive. (Indeed, to the extent that the pursuit of positive affect is far less
likely to result in the formation of very strong theory, it may tend rather
less toward tautology.) Allow each theory its own, different prime motive,
at any rate—the anticipation of pain in one case, the provision of pleasure
in the other—and neither can be called more realistic than the other. It’s not
even necessarily true that the two make different judgments of "reality":
it isn’t that one is pessimistic and sees the glass as half empty, while the
other is optimistic and sees it as half full. In a world full of loss, pain, and
oppression, both epistemologies are likely to be based on deep pessimism:
the reparative motive of seeking pleasure, after all, arrives, by Klein’s ac-
count, only with the achievement of a depressive position. But what each
looks for—which is again to say, the motive each has for looking—is bound
to differ widely. Of the two, however, it is only paranoid knowledge that
has so thorough a practice of disavowing its affective motive and force and
masquerading as the very stuff of truth.

paranoia places its faith in exposure
Whatever account it may give of its own motivation, paranoia is charac-
terized by placing, in practice, an extraordinary stress on the efficacy of
knowledge per se—knowledge in the form of exposure. Maybe that’s why
paranoid knowing is so inescapably narrative. Like the deinstitutionalized
person on the street who, betrayed and plotted against by everyone else in
the city, still urges on you the finger-worn dossier bristling with his pre-
cious correspondence, paranoia for all its vaunted suspicion acts as though
its work would be accomplished if only it could finally, this time, somehow
get its story truly known. That a fully initiated listener could still remain
indifferent or inimical, or might have no help to offer, is hardly treated as a
possibility.

It’s strange that a hermeneutics of suspicion would appear so trusting
about the effects of exposure, but Nietzsche (through the genealogy of
morals), Marx (through the theory of ideology), and Freud (through the
theory of ideals and illusions) already represent, in Ricoeur’s phrase, "con-
vergent procedures of demystification" (34) and therefore a seeming faith,
inexplicable in their own terms, in the effects of such a proceeding. In the
inﬂuential final pages of Gender Trouble, for example, Butler offers a pro-
grammatic argument in favor of demystification as "the normative focus
for gay and lesbian practice" (124), with such claims as that "drag implicitly
reveals the imitative structure of gender itself" (137); "we see sex and gen-
der denaturalized by means of a performance" (138); "gender parody reveals
that the original identity...isanimitation" (138); "gender performance will
enact and reveal the performativity of gender itself" (139); "parodic repeti-
tion...exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity" (141); "the paro-
dic repetition of gender exposes . . . the illusion of gender identity" (146); and
"hyperbolic exhibitions of ‘the natural’...reveal its fundamentally phan-
tasmatic status" (147) as well as "exposing its fundamental unnaturalness"
(149; all emphases added).

What marks the paranoid impulse in these pages is, I would say, less even
the stress on reﬂexive mimesis than the seeming faith in exposure.The arch-
suspicious author of The Novel and the Police also speaks, in this case, for the
protocols of many less interesting recent critics when he offers to provide
"the ‘ﬂash’ of increased visibility necessary to render modern discipline a
problem in its own right" (D. A. Miller, ix)—as though to make something
visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from get-
ting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction. In this respect
at least, though not in every one, Miller in The Novel and the Police writes as
an exemplary New Historicist. For, to a startling extent, the articulations
of New Historicist scholarship rely on the prestige of a single, overarching
narrative: exposing and problematizing hidden violences in the genealogy
of the modern liberal subject.

With the passage of time since the New Historicism was new, it’s be-
coming easier to see the ways that such a paranoid project of exposure may
be more historically specific than it seems. "The modern liberal subject":
by now it seems, or ought to seem, anything but an obvious choice as the
unique terminus ad quem of historical narrative. Where are all these sup-
posed modern liberal subjects? I daily encounter graduate students who are
dab hands at unveiling the hidden historical violences that underlie a secu-
lar, universalist liberal humanism. Yet these students’ sentient years, unlike
the formative years of their teachers, have been spent entirely in a xeno-
phobic Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush America where "liberal" is, if anything,
a taboo category and where "secular humanism" is routinely treated as a
marginal religious sect, while a vast majority of the population claims to
engage in direct intercourse with multiple invisible entities such as angels,
Satan, and God.

Furthermore, the force of any interpretive project of unveiling hidden vio-

Foucault’s early works, in which violence would be deprecated and hence
hidden in the first place.Why bother exposing the ruses of power in a coun-
try where, at any given moment, 40 percent of young black men are en-
meshed in the penal system? In the United States and internationally, while
there is plenty of hidden violence that requires exposure there is also, and
increasingly, an ethos where forms of violence that are hypervisible from
the start may be offered as an exemplary spectacle rather than remain to be
unveiled as a scandalous secret. Human rights controversy around, for ex-
ample, torture and disappearances in Argentina or the use of mass rape as
part of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia marks, not an unveiling of practices that
had been hidden or naturalized, but a wrestle of different frameworks of
visibility. That is, violence that was from the beginning exemplary and spec-
tacular, pointedly addressed, meant to serve as a public warning or terror to
members of a particular community is combated by efforts to displace and
redirect (as well as simply expand) its aperture of visibility.

A further problem with these critical practices: What does a hermeneu-
tics of suspicion and exposure have to say to social formations in which visi-
bility itself constitutes much of the violence? The point of the reinstatement
of chain gangs in several Southern states is less that convicts be required to
perform hard labor than that they be required to do so under the gaze of the
public, and the enthusiasm for Singapore-style justice that was popularly
expressed in the United States around the caning of Michael Fay revealed a
growing feeling that well-publicized shaming stigma is just what the doctor
ordered for recalcitrant youth. Here is one remarkable index of historical
change: it used to be opponents of capital punishment who argued that, if
practiced at all, executions should be done in public so as to shame state
and spectators by the airing of previously hidden judicial violence. Today
it is no longer opponents but death penalty cheerleaders, ﬂushed with tri-
umphal ambitions, who consider that the proper place for executions is on
television. What price now the cultural critics’ hard-won skill at making
visible, behind permissive appearances, the hidden traces of oppression and
persecution?

The paranoid trust in exposure seemingly depends, in addition, on an
infinite reservoirof naïveté in those who make up the audience for these un-
veilings. What is the basis for assuming that it will surprise or disturb, never
mind motivate, anyone to learn that a given social manifestation is artifi-
cial, self-contradictory, imitative, phantasmatic, or even violent? As Peter
Sloterdijk points out, cynicism or "enlightened false consciousness"—false
consciousness that knows itself to be false, "its falseness already reﬂexively
buffered"—already represents "the universally widespread way in which
enlightened people see to it that they are not taken for suckers" (5). How
television-starved would someone have to be to find it shocking that ide-
ologies contradict themselves, that simulacra don’t have originals, or that
gender representations are artificial? My own guess is that such popular
cynicism, though undoubtedly widespread, is only one among the hetero-
geneous, competing theories that constitute the mental ecology of most
people. Some exposés, some demystifications, some bearings of witness do
have great effectual force (though often of an unanticipated kind). Many
that are just as true and convincing have none at all, however, and as long
as that is so, we must admit that the efficacy and directionality of such acts
reside somewhere else than in their relation to knowledge per se.

Writing in 1988—that is, after two full terms of Reaganism in the United

being pathologized by my therapist than about my vanishing mental health

This development, however, is the last thing anyone could have expected
from reading New Historicist prose, which constitutes a full genealogy of
the secular welfare state that peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, along with a
watertight proof of why things must become more and more like that for-
ever. No one can blame a writer in the 1980s for not having foreseen the
effects of the Republicans’ 1994 Contract with America. But if, as Miller
says, "Surprise...isprecisely what the paranoid seeks to eliminate," it must
be admitted that, as a form of paranoia, the New Historicism fails spec-
tacularly. While its general tenor of "things are bad and getting worse" is
immune to refutation, any more specific predictive value—and as a result,
arguably, any value for making oppositional strategy—has been nil. Such
accelerating failure to anticipate change is, moreover, as I’ve discussed, en-
tirely in the nature of the paranoid process, whose sphere of inﬂuence (like
that of the New Historicism itself ) onlyexpands as each unanticipated disas-
ter seems to demonstrate more conclusively that, guess what, you can never

To look from a present day vantage at Richard Hofstadter’s immensely
inﬂuential 1963 essay "The Paranoid Style in American Politics" is to see
the extent of a powerful discursive change. Hofstadter’s essay is a prime ex-
pression of the complacent, coercive liberal consensus that practically begs
for the kind of paranoid demystification in which, for example, D. A. Miller
educates his readers. Its style is mechanically even-handed: Hofstadter finds
paranoia on both left and right: among abolitionists, anti-Masons and anti-
Catholics and anti-Mormons, nativists and populists and those who believe
in conspiracies of bankers or munitions makers; in anyone who doubts that
JFK was killed by a lone gunman, "in the popular left-wing press, in the
contemporary American right wing, and on both sides of the race contro-
versy today" (9). Although these categories seem to cover a lot of people,
there remains nonetheless a presumptive "we"—apparently still practically
everyone—who can agree to view such extremes from a calm, understand-
ing, and encompassing middle ground, where "we" can all agree that, for
example, though "innumerable decisions of...thecold war can be faulted,"
they represent "simply the mistakes of well-meaning men" (36). Hofstadter
has no trouble admitting that paranoid people or movements can perceive
true things, though "a distorted style is...apossible signal that may alert us
to a distorted judgment, just as in art an ugly style is a cue to fundamental
defects of taste" (6):

> A few simple and relatively non-controversial examples may make [the dis-
> tinction between content and style] wholly clear. Shortly after the assassi-

I won’t deny that a person could get nostalgic for a time when paranoid
gun lobby rhetoric sounded just plain nutty—a "simple and relatively non-
controversial" example of "distorted judgment"—rather than representing
the almost uncontested platform of a dominant political party. But the spec-
tacular datedness of Hofstadter’s example isn’t only an index of how far the
American political center has shifted toward the right since 1963. It’s also a
sign of how normative such paranoid thinking has become at every point
in the political spectrum. In a funny way, I feel closer today to that paranoid
Arizonan than I do to Hofstadter—even though, or do I mean because, I
also assume that the Arizonan is a homophobic white-supremacist Chris-
tian Identity militia member who would as soon blow me away as look
at me. Peter Sloterdijk does not make explicit that the wised-up popular
cynicism or "enlightened false consciousness" that he considers now to be
near ubiquitous is, specifically, paranoid in structure. But that conclusion
seems inescapable. Arguably, such narrow-gauge, everyday, rather incoher-
ent cynicism is what paranoia looks like when it functions as weak theory
rather than strong theory. To keep arriving on this hyperdemystified, para-
noid scene with the "news" of a hermeneutics of suspicion, at any rate, is a
far different act from what such exposures would have been in the 1960s.

Subversive and demystifying parody, suspicious archaeologies of the
present, the detection of hidden patterns of violence and their exposure:
as I have been arguing, these infinitely doable and teachable protocols of
unveiling have become the common currency of cultural and historicist
studies. If there is an obvious danger in the triumphalism of a paranoid her-
meneutics, it is that the broad consensual sweep of such methodological
assumptions, the current near professionwide agreement about what con-
stitutes narrative orexplanationoradequate historicization may,if it persists
unquestioned, unintentionally impoverish the gene pool of literary-critical
perspectives and skills. The trouble with a shallow gene pool, of course, is
its diminished ability to respond to environmental (e.g., political) change.

Another, perhaps more nearly accurate way of describing the present
paranoid consensus, however, is that rather than entirely displacing, it may
simply have required a certain disarticulation, disavowal, and misrecogni-
tion of other ways of knowing, ways less oriented around suspicion, that
are actually being practiced, often by the same theorists and as part of the
same projects. The monopolistic program of paranoid knowing systemati-
cally disallows any explicit recourse to reparative motives, no sooner to be
articulated than subject to methodical uprooting. Reparative motives, once
theybecome explicit, are inadmissible in paranoid theory both because they
are about pleasure ("merely aesthetic") and because they are frankly ame-
liorative ("merely reformist").

wise it wouldn’t have been) and intolerable (as if intolerable situations were

Such ugly prescriptions are not seriously offered by most paranoid
theory, but a lot of contemporary theory is nonetheless regularly structured
as if by them. The kind of aporia we have already discussed inThe Novel and
the Police, where readers are impelled through a grimly monolithic struc-
ture of strong paranoid theory by successive engagement with quite varied,
often apparently keenly pleasure-oriented, smaller-scale writerly and intel-
lectual solicitations, appears in a lot of other good criticism as well. I cer-
tainly recognize it as characterizing a fair amount of my own writing. Does
it matter when such projects misdescribe themselves or are misrecognized
by readers? I wouldn’t suggest that the force of any powerful writing can
ever attain complete transparency to itself, or is likely to account for itself
very adequatelyat the constative level of the writing. But suppose one takes
seriously the notion, like the one articulated by Tomkins but also like other
available ones, that everyday theory qualitatively affects everyday knowl-
edge and experience; and suppose that one doesn’t want to draw much
ontological distinction between academic theory and everyday theory; and
suppose that one has a lot of concern for the quality of other people’s and
one’s own practices of knowing and experiencing. In these cases, it would
make sense—if one had the choice—not to cultivate the necessity of a sys-
tematic, self-accelerating split between what one is doing and the reasons
one does it.

While paranoid theoretical proceedings both depend on and reinforce
the structural dominance of monopolistic "strong theory," there may also
be benefit in exploring the extremely varied, dynamic, and historically con-
tingent ways that strong theoretical constructs interact with weak ones in
the ecologyof knowing—an exploration that obviouslycan’t proceed with-
out a respectful interest in weak as well as strong theoretical acts. Tomkins
offers far more models for approaching such a project than I’ve been able
to summarize. But the history of literary criticism can also be viewed as
a repertoire of alternative models for allowing strong and weak theory to
interdigitate. What could better represent "weak theory, little better than
a description of the phenomena which it purports to explain," than the de-
valued and near obsolescent New Critical skill of imaginative close read-
ing?

But what was already true in Empson and Burke is true in a differ-

that can be accomplished only through local theories and nonce taxono-

theories remain matters of art and speculative thought.

Paranoia, as I have pointed out, represents not only a strong affect theory
but a strong negative affect theory. The question of the strength of a given
theory (or that of the relations between strong and weak theory) may be
orthogonal to the question of its affective quale, and each may be capable
of exploration by different means. A strong theory (i.e., a wide-ranging and
reductive one) that was not mainly organized around anticipating, identify-
ing, and warding off the negative affect of humiliation would resemble para-
noia in some respects but differ from it in others. I think, for example, that
that might be a fair characterization of the preceding section of the present
chapter. Becauseeventhe specificationof paranoiaas a theoryof negative af-
fect leaves open the distinctions between or among negative affects, there is
the additional opportunity of experimenting with a vocabulary that will do
justice to a wide affective range. Again, not only with the negative affects: it
can also be reifying and, indeed, coercive to have only one, totalizing model
of positive affect always in the same featured position. A disturbingly large
amount of theory seems explicitly to undertake the proliferation of only
one affect, or maybe two, of whatever kind—whether ecstasy, sublimity,
self-shattering, jouissance, suspicion, abjection, knowingness, horror, grim
satisfaction, or righteous indignation. It’s like the old joke: "Comes the revo-
lution, Comrade, everyone gets to eat roast beef everyday." "But Comrade,
I don’t like roast beef." "Comes the revolution, Comrade, you’ll like roast
beef." Comes the revolution, Comrade, you’ll be tickled pink by those de-
constructive jokes; you’ll faint from ennui every minute you’re not smash-
ing the state apparatus; you’ll definitely want hot sex twenty to thirty times

To recognize in paranoia a distinctively rigid relation to temporality, at
once anticipatory and retroactive, averse above all to surprise, is also to
glimpse thelineaments of other possibilities. Here, perhaps,Klein is of more
help than Tomkins: to read from a reparative position is to surrender the
knowing, anxious paranoid determination that no horror, however appar-
ently unthinkable, shall ever come to the reader as new; to a reparatively
positioned reader, it can seem realistic and necessary to experience sur-
prise. Because there can be terrible surprises, however, there can also be
good ones. Hope, often a fracturing, even a traumatic thing to experience,
is among the energies by which the reparatively positioned reader tries to
organize thefragments and part-objects she encounters orcreates.

Because
the reader has room to realize that the future may be different from the
present, it is also possible for her to entertain such profoundly painful, pro-
foundlyrelieving, ethicallycrucial possibilitiesas that the past, in turn, could
have happened differently from the way it actually did.

Where does this argument leave projects of queer reading, in particu-
lar? With the relative deemphasis of the question of "sexual difference"
and sexual "sameness," and with the possibility of moving from a Freudian,
homophobia-centered understanding of paranoia to other understandings
of it, like Klein’s or Tomkins’s, that are not particularly Oedipal and are less
drive-oriented than affect-oriented, I am also suggesting that the mutual
inscription of queer thought with the topic of paranoia may be less neces-
sary, less definitional, less completely constitutive than earlier writing on it,
very much including myown, has assumed. A more ecological viewof para-
noia wouldn’t offer the same transhistorical, almost automatic conceptual
privileging of gay/lesbian issues that is offered by a Freudian view.
On the other hand, I think it will leave us in a vastly better position to
do justice to a wealth of characteristic, culturally central practices, many
of which can well be called reparative, that emerge from queer experience
but become invisible or illegible under a paranoid optic. As Joseph Litvak

It’s appropriate, I think, that these insights would be contingent develop-
ments rather than definitional or transhistorical ones: theyaren’t things that
would inevitably inhere in the experience of every woman-loving woman
or man-loving man, say. For if, as I’ve shown, a paranoid reading practice is
closely tied to a notion of the inevitable, there are other features of queer
reading that can attune it exquisitely to a heartbeat of contingency.

The dogged, defensive narrative stiffness of a paranoid temporality, after
all, in which yesterday can’t be allowed to have differed from today and
tomorrow must be even more so, takes its shape from a generational narra-
tive that’s characterized bya distinctly Oedipal regularityand repetitiveness:
it happened to my father’s father, it happened to my father, it is happening
to me, it will happen to my son, and it will happen to my son’s son. But isn’t
it a feature of queer possibility—only a contingent feature, but a real one,
and one that in turn strengthens the force of contingency itself—that our
generational relations don’t always proceed in this lockstep?

Think of the epiphanic, extravagantly reparative final volume of Proust,
in which the narrator, after a long withdrawal from society, goes to a party
where he at first thinks everyone is sporting elaborate costumes pretend-
ing to be ancient, then realizes that they are old, and so is he—and is then
assailed, in half a dozen distinct mnemonic shocks, by a climactic series of
joy-inducing "truths" about the relation of writing to time. The narrator
never says so, but isn’t it worth pointing out that the complete temporal
disorientation that initiates him into this revelatory space would have been
impossible in a heterosexual père de famille, in onewho had meanwhile been
embodying, in the form of inexorably "progressing" identities and roles,
the regular arrival of children and grandchildren?

A more recent contingency, in the brutal foreshortening of so many
queer life spans, has deroutinized the temporality of many of us in ways
that only intensify this effect. I’m thinking, as I say this, of three very queer
friendships I have. One of my friends is sixty; the other two are both thirty,
and I, at forty-five, am exactly in the middle. All four of us are academics,
and we have in common a lot of interests, energies, and ambitions; we have
each had, as well, variously intense activist investments. In a "normal" gen-
erational narrative, our identifications with each other would be aligned
with an expectation that in another fifteen years, I’d be situated comparably
to where my sixty-year-old friend is, while my thirty-year-old friends would
be situated comparably to where I am.

But we are all aware that the grounds of such friendships today are likely
to differ from that model. They do so in inner cities, and for people subject
to racist violence, and for people deprived of health care, and for people in
dangerous industries, and for many others; they do so for my friends and
me. Specifically, living with advanced breast cancer, I have little chance of
ever being the age my older friend is now. My friends who are thirty are
equally unlikely ever to experience my present, middle age: one is living
with an advanced cancer caused by a massive environmental trauma (basi-
cally, he grew up on top of a toxic waste site); the other is living with HIV.
The friend who is a very healthy sixty is much the likeliest of us to be living
fifteen years from now.

It’s hard to say, hard even to know, how these relationships are different
from those shared by people of different ages on a landscape whose per-
spectival lines converge on a common disappearing-point. I’m sure ours are
more intensely motivated: whateverelse we know, we know there isn’t time
to bullshit. But what it means to identify with each other must also be very
different. On this scene, an older person doesn’t love a younger as someone
whowill someday bewhere she now is, or vice versa. No one is, so to speak,
passing on the family name; there’s a sense in which our life narratives will
barelyoverlap.There’s another sense in which they slide up more intimately
alongside one another than can any lives that are moving forward according
to the regular schedule of the generations. It is one another immediately,
one another as the present fullness of a becoming whose arc may extend
no further, whom we each must learn best to apprehend, fulfill, and bear
company.

At a textual level, it seems to me that related practices of reparative know-
ing may lie, barely recognized and little explored, at the heart of many histo-
ries of gay, lesbian, and queer intertextuality. The queer-identified practice
of camp, for example, may be seriously misrecognized when it is viewed,
as Butler and others view it, through paranoid lenses. As we’ve seen, camp
is most often understood as uniquely appropriate to the projects of parody,
denaturalization, demystification, and mocking exposure of the elements
and assumptions of a dominant culture. And the degree to which camping
is motivated by love seems often to be understood mainly as the degree of
its self-hating complicity with an oppressive status quo. By this account, the
x-ray gaze of the paranoid impulse in camp sees through to an unﬂeshed
skeleton of the culture; the paranoid aesthetic on view here is one of mini-
malist elegance and conceptual economy.

The desire of a reparative impulse, on the other hand, is additive and
accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inade-
quate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude
on an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self. To
viewcamp as, among other things, the communal, historicallydense explo-
ration of a varietyof reparative practices is to do better justice to manyof the
defining elements of classic camp performance: the startling, juicy displays
of excess erudition, for example; the passionate, often hilarious antiquari-
anism, the prodigal production of alternative historiographies; the "over"-
attachment to fragmentary, marginal, waste or leftover products; the rich,
highly interruptive affective variety; the irrepressible fascination with ven-
triloquistic experimentation; the disorienting juxtapositions of present with
past, and popular with high culture.

As in the writing of D. A. Miller, a
glue of surplus beauty, surplus stylistic investment, unexplained upwellings
of threat, contempt, and longing cements together and animates the amal-
gam of powerful part-objects in such work as that of Ronald Firbank, Djuna
Barnes, Joseph Cornell, Kenneth Anger, Charles Ludlam, Jack Smith, John
Waters, and Holly Hughes.

The very mention of these names, some of them attaching to almost
legendarily "paranoid" personalities, confirms, too, Klein’s insistence that
it is not people but mutable positions—or, I would want to say, practices—
that can be divided between the paranoid and the reparative; it is sometimes
the most paranoid-tending people who are able to, and need to, develop
and disseminate the richest reparative practices. And if the paranoid or the
depressive positions operate on a smaller scale than the level of individual
typology, they operate also on a larger: that of shared histories, emergent
communities, and the weaving of intertextual discourse.

Like Proust, the reparative reader "helps himself again and again"; it is
not only important but possible to find ways of attending to such repara-
tive motives and positionalities.Thevocabulary for articulating any reader’s
reparative motive toward a text or a culture has long been so sappy, aes-
theticizing, defensive, anti-intellectual, or reactionary that it’s no wonder
fewcritics are willing to describe their acquaintance with such motives.The
prohibitive problem, however, has been in the limitations of present theo-
retical vocabularies rather than in the reparative motive itself. No less acute
than a paranoid position, no less realistic, no less attached to a project of
survival, and neither less nor more delusional or fantasmatic, the repara-
tive reading position undertakes a different range of affects, ambitions, and
risks. What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many
ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the ob-
jects of a culture—even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been
not to sustain them.

1. Laplanche and Pontalis, in their entry under "Pleasure Principle," show that Freud was
long aware of this problem. They paraphrase: "Must we therefore be content with a
purely economic definition and accept that pleasure and unpleasure are nothing more
than the translation of quantitative changes into qualitative terms? And what then is
the precise correlation between these two aspects, the qualitative and the quantitative?
Little by little, Freud came to lay considerable emphasis on the great difficultyencoun-
tered in the attempt to provide a simple answer to this question" (323). In Chapter 3,
Adam Frank and I describe Tomkins’s work on affect in terms that try to respond to
this way of posing the problem.
2. The barely implicit sneer with which Leo Bersani wields the term "redemption"
throughout The Culture of Redemption might be one good example of the latter kind of
usage—except that Bersani’s revulsion seems to attach, not quite to the notion that
things could be ameliorated, but rather to the pious reification of Art as the appointed
agent of such change.
3. Thanks to Tyler Curtain for pointing this out to me.
4. I am thinking here of Timothy Gould’s interpretation (in a personal communication,
1994) of Emily Dickinson’s poem that begins " ‘Hope’ is the thing with feathers—/
That perches in the soul—" (116, poem no. 254). Gould suggests that the symptoms
of ﬂuttering hope are rather like those of posttraumatic stress disorder, with the dif-
ference that the apparently absent cause of perturbation lies in the future, rather than
in the past.
5. I don’t mean to hypostatize, here, "the way it actually did" happen, or to deny how
constructed a thing this "actually did" may be—within certain constraints. The realm
of what might have happened but didn’t is, however, ordinarily even wider and less con-
strained,and it seems conceptuallyimportantthat thetwonot be collapsed;otherwise,
the entire possibility of things’ happening differently can be lost.
6. Michael Moon’s A Small Boy and Others is one book that conveys this richer sense of
queer culture.
