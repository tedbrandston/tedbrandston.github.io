During my time at Neverware I took a turn that has the director of engineering, and it really changed how I thought about the word "respect".

Folks on the leadership team used it pretty regularly, and at some point I took issue with it. The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was "deference to authority", and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.

After some discussion and looking up the various definitions, I found one that helped me understand what people were trying to express: "due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others."

That sentiment is actually something that I strongly agree with.

I also can see how that definition could come to be synonymous with "deference to authority" in a highly hierarchical business world: The people with the power to demand regard for their feelings and traditions are those in positions of authority.
