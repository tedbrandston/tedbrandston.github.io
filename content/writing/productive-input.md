Something that came up many times at Neverware was the concept of doing things "productively" or "unproductively", especially communication. But what does that even mean? There's a way in which, like "professional" it can feel like a pretty arbitrary standard: if I point out a problem I see, are people going to be upset because I wasn't 'productive' enough?

Wiktionary has a couple of relevant [definitions](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/productive#Adjective), of which I'll highlight "Yielding good or useful results; constructive." Communication is hard, and not every way of expressing an observation is equally likely to yield good or useful results.

"Positive input" (e.g. praise) is generally easy for people to get right, so it's generally considered productive (though there's certainly ways to praise unproductively).

When we offer criticism or point out things that could be done better, what are we trying to achieve? We're generally trying to improve the situation, so it's worthwhile to think about how to phrase our criticism to make it more productive. How will our words be understood by other people? Will its intended audience be likely to make good/useful changes after reading or hearing it? Will they understand what you see as the problem? Will they feel defensive?

This ties back to [respect](/writing/respect): it requires "due regard for the feelings [...] and traditions of others."

Some things can make this hard:
