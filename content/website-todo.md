TODO:
* Figure out how I want to do comments
  - Then set it all up
* Add index pages to footer
* Figure out a better way to do summaries. I feel like I have to format things with both the summary view and the page view in mind.
* link liveness checker
  - make sure all internal links are valid
  - make sure external links aren't redirecting or 404'ing (or 503...)
