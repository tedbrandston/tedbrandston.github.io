### Who am I?

A question that pops into my head when nothing else is going on.

In no particular order:
* A parent of two small kids.
* A software engineer. 
* Someone who cares about communication.

### What is this?

I'll be trying to use this website to document some of my thoughts/ideas. 
I suspect some will be useful, others will not. Some will be interesting, others
will be quite mundane.
Hopefully once I've written them down it'll be easier to think _other_ thoughts,
_newer_ thoughts.
