Based on Cliff Biffle's tremendously cool [rust+webassembly series](https://cliffle.com/blog/bare-metal-wasm/). This just flips through the various "1D" cellular automata you can make with two states and self+neighbor patterns, choosing from a few possible starting states. Most of 'em end up not that interesting, but it was fun to practice my rust.
