# "How things usually are" is not "how things should be"

I have two small children, and it seems like there's a certain age where they decide that how things usually are is how they should be. How they must be!

I feel like a classic example for this is "Boys don't have long hair!"

And while I think kids are known for doing this because they do it clumsily, I think adults do it as well. It seems like a lot of social changes over the past several decades are from people pushing back against the expectation that how most people do something is how it should be done. The only acceptable way!
