I asked about it, and that evening Sandy, his wife &amp;amp; also our neighbor, dropped off a jar of roasted vegetables. They were as good as they smelled, and she gave me an approximate recipe. I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to quite replicate it, but my attempts have been pretty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Two Tomato Soups</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/two-tomato-soups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/two-tomato-soups/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The basic framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put some tomatoes in a pot with seasonings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook until thoroughly softened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly strain out the solids (and remove any large pieces of herb), reserving the juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puree the solids to make a thick tomato soup (or base for pizza sauce) perfect for dunking grilled cheese into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the juice as a broth for another soup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: I put onions, garlic, fresh sage, and fresh rosemary, and olive oil in. I used the juice to make a kale &amp;amp; white bean soup.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
