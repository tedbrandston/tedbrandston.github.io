Put some tomatoes in a pot with seasonings Cook until thoroughly softened Lightly strain out the solids (and remove any large pieces of herb), reserving the juice Puree the solids to make a thick tomato soup (or base for pizza sauce) perfect for dunking grilled cheese into Use the juice as a broth for another soup For example: I put onions, garlic, fresh sage, and fresh rosemary, and olive oil in.</description></item></channel></rss>
