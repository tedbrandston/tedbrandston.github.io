They also sell &amp;ldquo;second quality&amp;rdquo; apples in big boxes at a discount. At this time of year I like to make a bunch of applesauce, and freeze most of it for the winter and spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve got my weird ideas about how to best make applesauce. I like to add pears because I think it adds a nice slightly-floral element. I also add lemon juice while cooking, because back circa 2011 I read part of The Blue Chair Jam Cookbook and it described how pectin, sugar, and acid combine to make jelly. Apples are high in pectin and sugar, so just adding lemon juice while cooking seems to result in a smoother, &amp;ldquo;fuller&amp;rdquo; texture. All the tweaks and spices and stuff are totally optional, though, because you can make a really nice applesauce with nothing but apples.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
