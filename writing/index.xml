&lt;p>My impression is that in most organizations there are moments when things happen, the result of those things is bad for the organization or the people in it, and so the organization says: &amp;ldquo;Never Again. We will put rules and processes in place to ensure that this Can&amp;rsquo;t Happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Respect</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my time at Neverware I took a turn that has the director of engineering, and it really changed how I thought about the word &amp;ldquo;respect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Folks on the leadership team used it pretty regularly, and at some point I took issue with it. The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &amp;ldquo;deference to authority&amp;rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solar Biochar at Home</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>An idea: solar biochar at home&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while back I read about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar">biochar&lt;/a>. I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/">HOPE 2020&lt;/a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk&lt;/a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/">this article&lt;/a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We don't all interpret words the same ways</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think the last chapter of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739320-because-internet">&lt;em>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by Gretchen McCulloch describes beautifully the way we each have our own, personal version of our languages, and what&amp;rsquo;s captured in the dictionary is more of an aggregate snapshot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What she doesn&amp;rsquo;t get into is how many problems it can cause.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Eco Friendly</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing about &lt;a href="https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home.md">a solar biochar kiln&lt;/a> left me thinking a lot about how to define &amp;ldquo;eco friendly&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been thinking about it in relation to some news a friend pointed me at: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/to-tote-or-note-to-tote/498557/">canvas&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/style/cotton-totes-climate-crisis.html">bags&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1585027/when-it-comes-to-climate-change-cotton-totes-might-be-worse-than-plastic/">are&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/01/22/is-your-reusable-tote-worse-for-the-environment-than-a-plastic-bag">worse&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/sustainable-living/cotton-tote-bags-sustainable-shopping-b1909035.html">than&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.rateitgreen.com/green-building-community/discussions/plastic-vs-reusable-bags-which-bag-is-best/1340">plastic&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/579437/cotton-canvas-tote-bad-for-environment">bags&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hFgtIziShmc">Poor Tim Minchin&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I should note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed. I know, I know, I know &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m part of the problem. They also mostly cite the same couple of studies. I might try to write more about that later&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
