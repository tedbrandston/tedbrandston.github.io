Based on the date on that transcript I must have been at least seven or eight years old, and I don&rsquo;t think I was older than about twelve. Anyway, in it this comedian talks about meeting his college roommate who suggests they split &ldquo;a pie&rdquo;, which apparently is not used to mean a pizza where he grew up. I may not call pizza &ldquo;pie&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ve had enough exposure to that usage that I can interpret it correctly in most contexts. This idea, that regionalisms like this could so confuse people, blew Little Ted&rsquo;s mind. It really stuck with me.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just regional variations, though. An example I&rsquo;m regularly reminded of in daily life are the words &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;racist&rdquo;.</p><p>As a child of the 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, the common definition I was aware of for &ldquo;racism&rdquo; was something along the lines of &ldquo;people being treated badly because of others&rsquo; bigoted views about their race&rdquo;, and for &ldquo;racist&rdquo; something like &ldquo;a person with bigoted views about racial groups&rdquo;. In college, around the time I read <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433281.Racism_without_Racists><em>Racism without Racists</em></a> by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, I noticed that some people were using racism to somewhat synonymously with &ldquo;structural racism&rdquo;, i.e. &ldquo;the outcome of systems that, intentionally or not, benefit one racial group over another/treat one racial group as more worthy&rdquo;. Racist, then, can mean something more like &ldquo;a person who, intentionally or not, supports systems that benefit one racial group over another/treat one racial group as more worthy&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that there were folks who had always used these words these ways and I was only noticing it then because of what I was reading, but my impression is that in the late 00&rsquo;s/early 10&rsquo;s this usage became much more prevalent in certain groups.</p><p>And, it kind of makes sense: If you&rsquo;re talking a lot about a particular topic you&rsquo;ll notice details, minor differences that you want to be able to succinctly describe. You want your words to capture what you&rsquo;re seeing, and if you&rsquo;re not seeing many people openly expressing bigoted beliefs but you <em>are</em> seeing these harmful structures it makes sense to adapt your language. This happens all the time: it&rsquo;s called jargon. For an example from software engineering: we often distinguish between &ldquo;text files&rdquo; and &ldquo;binary files&rdquo;, even though text is also stored as binary on disk.</p><p>But there are problems when people from different groups use the same word to mean different thing. For an extreme example, my middle-school French teacher told a story about the dirty looks she got when taking her daughter to the zoo, and pointing out the seals: &ldquo;un phoque!&rdquo; (pronounced a lot like fuck). That&rsquo;s a different language and people were upset about it. When people who think racist means bigoted talk to people who think racist means something structural, there&rsquo;s understandable confusion. You can even have someone saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a racist&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t think less of someone because of skin color) and someone else saying &ldquo;yes you are!&rdquo; (you&rsquo;re supporting this system), and they&rsquo;re both right (each from their own perspective).</p><p>So, next time you find yourself at odds with someone, it might be worth double-checking: are you even talking about the same thing?</p><div class=meta><span>Last modified:
