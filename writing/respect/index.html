The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.</p><p>After some discussion and looking up the various definitions, I found one that helped me understand what people were trying to express: &ldquo;due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.&rdquo;</p><p>That sentiment is actually something that I strongly agree with.</p><p>I also can see how that definition could come to be synonymous with &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo; in a highly hierarchical business world: The people with the power to demand regard for their feelings and traditions are those in positions of authority.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.&rdquo;</p><p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s implied by that, and I think it covers a lot of what I believe about how we should live our lives. Pay attention to the people around you. Do your best to do right by them, not just &ldquo;as you&rsquo;d have done to you&rdquo;, but as <em>they</em> want done to them. &ldquo;Due regard for&rdquo; not &ldquo;perfect compliance with&rdquo;, you also have to attend to your own feelings, etc.</p><p>I also think there are a couple of situations where it gets really nuanced:</p><ul><li>Sometimes people&rsquo;s wishes or traditions conflict with each other. There&rsquo;s thousands of years of writing about what to do when people want conflicting things. I won&rsquo;t attempt to summarize here.</li><li>Sometimes people&rsquo;s feelings/wishes/traditions are self-destructive, even if in small ways. I think you could view this as a sub-point of people&rsquo;s wishes or traditions conflicting (my kid wishes to eat Annie&rsquo;s mac and cheese for every meal, I wish for her to get a variety of nutrients and to develop a taste for a variety of foods), but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning separately because the connotation of conflict doesn&rsquo;t normally include this kind.</li></ul><div class=meta><span>Last modified:
