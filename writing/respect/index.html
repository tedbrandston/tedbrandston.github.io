The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.</p><p>After some discussion and looking up the various definitions, I found one that helped me understand what people were trying to express: &ldquo;due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.&rdquo;</p><p>That sentiment is actually something that I strongly agree with.</p><p>I also can see how that definition could come to be synonymous with &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo; in a highly hierarchical business world: The people with the power to demand regard for their feelings and traditions are those in positions of authority.</p><div class=meta><span>Last modified:
