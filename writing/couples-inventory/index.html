Just a list of questions we ask, to make sure we&rsquo;re addressing the things we need to be addressing. Here&rsquo;s an edited version of that list:</p><p>(And keep in mind: these are discussion points. None of these are yes/no.)</p><ol><li>Are we talking about things other than #children?</li><li>Are we talking about things other than #chickens?</li><li>Have we been talking about things that aren&rsquo;t just transactional?</li><li>Is one of us feeling left out?</li><li>Does it feel like we&rsquo;re pairing off with the kids in a way that isolates members of the family from one another?</li><li>Is one of us feeling like they&rsquo;re doing all the work?</li><li>Are we having enough sex? Do our bodies feel #dunbandon? Our hearts?</li><li>Are we setting aside time each week to be alone? Alone with OURSELves??!</li><li>Are we each taking care of our mental and physical health to ensure we are our BEST SELVES?</li><li>Are we respecting each other&rsquo;s outlook and opinion when we disagree? IS IT POSSIBLE THE OTHER PERSON IS RIGHT? ARE YOU USING I FEEL STATEMENTS?!?!!</li><li>Are our families too UP IN IT? Are we seeing them enough?</li><li>Are we doing our best to enjoy the present together?</li><li>Are we continuing to ensure our life paths align?</li><li>Do we feel like we&rsquo;re &ldquo;MINDING THE GAP&rdquo;?</li><li>Do we feel like we&rsquo;re each giving an equitable amount? Extending to help the other grow?</li><li>Are we doing our best to be gentle with everyone else in the household?</li><li>Are the questions we&rsquo;re asking helpful? Are there any questions we should be asking that we&rsquo;re not?</li></ol><p>Again, even when the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; we talk through specifics. When we identify something going awry, we talk about how we could do things differently. A lot of the time just identifying the problem is enough to improve things, but far from always.</p><p>Some notes on those, since they&rsquo;re a little jargony:</p><ol><li>It&rsquo;s very easy to end up just talking about this one shared project, when there&rsquo;s so much else in our lives to talk about.</li><li>This was added when we had some chickens living in the dining room, but now maybe applies to pets in general?</li><li>One thing that seems like it can happen in relationships, especially with kids, is that all the communication that <em>needs</em> to happen around when we&rsquo;re going to this place or what needs to be gotten from the store or whatever can take time away from the optional communication around things like &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; (beyond the quick, automatic phrase as you walk out the door or fall asleep [though that&rsquo;s important, too]) or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling ______ lately&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey, this thing we&rsquo;re doing together is fun!&rdquo;</li><li>Like, are the kids insisting on hanging out with one of us to the exclusion of the other.</li><li>Like, will one kid refuse to let one parent put them to bed.</li><li>Most of the time we each feel like the <em>other</em> one is doing most of the work, but it&rsquo;s helpful to talk through what we see the other one doing/what we feel like we&rsquo;re doing.</li><li>#dunbandon is &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;.</li><li>It&rsquo;s important to get time alone together, and to balance that with time you need alone with yourself.</li><li>This one is difficult, and covers so many things. Are we each getting enough sleep? Food? Restorative time? Exercise? Do we feel snappish? Frustrated with the kids/each other all the time? Am I getting headaches because I&rsquo;m not taking care of my back? Are our bodies hurting in other ways? Are we getting caught up in the vicissitudes of our day-to-day in ways that make us anxious or sad?</li><li>I think this started out as one of the first questions on the list. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept of speaking in I think/I feel statements, I think it&rsquo;s worth looking up.</li><li>Life goes through waves. Sometimes you see your family too much, sometimes not enough.</li><li>It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in &ldquo;someday&rdquo; (when the kids are in high school, when they&rsquo;re in college, when we retire&mldr;), but we don&rsquo;t want to spend X years suffering and then figure out how to enjoy later. Let&rsquo;s find a balance now. Also, there&rsquo;s this statistic about needing five positive interactions to offset each negative interaction &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple, but I do think it&rsquo;s important to enjoy each other most of the time to help us through the rough patches.</li><li>Once when Kat and I were talking to <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220630230428/https://www.ursinus.edu/live/news/2229-in-memory-rev-charles-rice>Reverend Charles Rice</a> he used a metaphor about &ldquo;aligning your life paths&rdquo; with this hand motion of two index fingers coming together and moving in the same direction. It really stuck with me, this image of all the things we do/all the choices we make being like paths in an N-dimensional space and us trying to make sure that we stay near each other. Making sure I don&rsquo;t set up my life to take me away from Kat physically/temporally/emotionally/spiritually/&mldr;</li><li>I think this was from Brené Brown&rsquo;s <em>Daring Greatly</em>. Minding the gap is about making sure we&rsquo;re acting in accordance with our ideals, and making sure the kids see us correcting ourselves when we do the wrong thing.</li><li>Equitable, not equal. This will fluctuate. &ldquo;Extending to help the other grow&rdquo; is either directly from or a paraphrase of bell hooks in <em>All About Love</em>.</li><li>I guess some of these are a little redundant. Let&rsquo;s just all try to stay calm and be nice to each other.</li><li>Update the list. We probably make a change every second or third time we go through the inventory.</li></ol><div class=meta><span>Last modified:
