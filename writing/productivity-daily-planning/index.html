I&rsquo;m not even sure their productivity is the right word for what I&rsquo;ve struggle with: some mix of organization, choosing what to work on, finding time to work on it, and then working on the thing that I intended to work on.</p><p>it&rsquo;s something I have struggled with both in work context and in a personal context, but recently I feel like I&rsquo;ve made some significant changes &ndash; and one in particular &ndash; that have really improved my ability to get things done at work (I&rsquo;m still working on bringing this to my personal time). I might touch on some of the others, but the biggest improvement seems to come from planning out what I&rsquo;m going to do at the beginning of each day.</p><hr><p>historically I have not had much confidence in the work that I do, nor felt sure that I was working on the right thing. many of my days have been bogged down in feeling like I wasn&rsquo;t working on the thing I really needed to do, or like I was dancing around doing the thing I needed to, avoiding it. I would sometimes have days where I got lots of little things done but not the larger thing that would require me to focus for an hour. there was also a lot of time spent after I finished in a given task thinking &ldquo;okay, what do I feel up to doing now?&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started taking 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of each work day to type up a rough set of things I can probably finish <em>that day</em>, and it has helped with basically all of the above problems.</p><p>it&rsquo;s not the full solution to all of the above problems:</p><ul><li>I had to do a decent amount of work around how I felt starting new/uncertain tasks.</li><li>had to switch from tracking an ongoing and ever growing list of to-do items to keeping a list of things I could do</li><li>I&rsquo;ve stopped treating the thing about how it takes you 15 minutes to recover full focus after an interruption and a rule, or as an excuse not to work on something if they only have a few minutes left</li></ul><p>still, since I started daily planning I spend almost no time dithering, wondering what to work on. I mostly work on the most important thing (I say mostly because I think that sometimes it&rsquo;s important to go with where your focus is drawing your attention, rather than always fighting it).</p><div class=meta><span>Last modified:
