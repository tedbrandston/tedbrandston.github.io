The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-2-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/ class=post-link>We don't all interpret words the same ways</a><div><p>I think the last chapter of <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739320-because-internet><em>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language</em></a> by Gretchen McCulloch describes beautifully the way we each have our own, personal version of our languages, and what&rsquo;s captured in the dictionary is more of an aggregate snapshot.</p><p>What she doesn&rsquo;t get into is how many problems it can cause.</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/ class=more>more...</a></div></div><div class=flex-row><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/anonymity/ class=post-link>Anonymity</a><div><p>Another significant Neverware memory is going over the company survey results. It was considered pretty important by most people that the submissions remain anonymous. A lot of the time that seemed fine, but sometimes it made very hard to make useful changes.</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/anonymity/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/comments-reasoning/ class=post-link>Comments on This Website</a><div><p>Comments online are hard. Moderating online conversations is hard. At the same time having that potential for interaction, for connection with other people, feels worth doing hard work for.</p><p>So how should comments work on this website?</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/comments-reasoning/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/never-again/ class=post-link>Never Again</a><div><p>Recently I have been thinking about the tendency in organizations to say: &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t let this happen Ever Again.&rdquo;</p><p>My impression is that in most organizations there are moments when things happen, the result of those things is bad for the organization or the people in it, and so the organization says: &ldquo;Never Again. We will put rules and processes in place to ensure that this Can&rsquo;t Happen.&rdquo;</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/never-again/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/ class=post-link>Solar Biochar at Home</a><div><p>An idea: solar biochar at home</p><p>A while back I read about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar>biochar</a>. I think it was not-too-long after I attended <a href=https://xiii.hope.net/>HOPE 2020</a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk>solarpunk</a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read <a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/>this article</a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/waist-deep-in-the-big-muddy/ class=post-link>Waist Deep in the Big Muddy</a><div><p>Yesterday, while Rosa and Juniper were in the bath, I put on <em>Waist Deep in the Big Muddy and other Love Songs</em><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> by Pete Seeger. It&rsquo;s an album I used to listen to on repeat when I was a little kid (my best guess is that I was somewhere in the 7 to 9 range), but I&rsquo;ve only listened to it once or twice in the past 20 years and&mldr; wow.</p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting the songs/bits of songs I remember and those that I don&rsquo;t. Most of the political messages went straight over my head.</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/waist-deep-in-the-big-muddy/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/ class=post-link>What Is Eco Friendly</a><div><p>Writing about <a href=/writing/solar-biochar-at-home.md>a solar biochar kiln</a> left me thinking a lot about how to define &ldquo;eco friendly&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve also been thinking about it in relation to some news a friend pointed me at: &ldquo;<a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/to-tote-or-note-to-tote/498557/>canvas</a> <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/style/cotton-totes-climate-crisis.html>bags</a> <a href=https://qz.com/1585027/when-it-comes-to-climate-change-cotton-totes-might-be-worse-than-plastic/>are</a> <a href=https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/01/22/is-your-reusable-tote-worse-for-the-environment-than-a-plastic-bag>worse</a> <a href=https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/sustainable-living/cotton-tote-bags-sustainable-shopping-b1909035.html>than</a> <a href=https://www.rateitgreen.com/green-building-community/discussions/plastic-vs-reusable-bags-which-bag-is-best/1340>plastic</a> <a href=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/579437/cotton-canvas-tote-bad-for-environment>bags</a>&rdquo;. <a href=https://youtu.be/hFgtIziShmc>Poor Tim Minchin</a>.</p><p>(I should note: I didn&rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed.
