The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &ldquo;deference to authority&rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-2-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/ class=post-link>We don't all interpret words the same ways</a><div>I think the last chapter of Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language by Gretchen McCulloch describes beautifully the way we each have our own, personal version of our languages, and what&rsquo;s captured in the dictionary is more of an aggregate snapshot.
One of my really early memories about this is of watching this comedy routine (I&rsquo;m astonished I was able to find this). Based on the date on that transcript I must have been at least seven or eight years old, and I don&rsquo;t think I was older than about twelve.</div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/ class=more>more...</a></div></div><div class=flex-row><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/never-again/ class=post-link>Never Again</a><div><p>Recently I have been thinking about the tendency in organizations to say: &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t let this happen Ever Again.&rdquo;</p><p>My impression is that in most organizations there are moments when things happen, the result of those things is bad for the organization or the people in it, and so the organization says: &ldquo;Never Again.

I think it was not-too-long after I attended <a href=https://xiii.hope.net/>HOPE 2020</a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk>solarpunk</a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read <a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/>this article</a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).</p></div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/ class=more>more...</a></div><div class="flex-row-item flex-row-unlimited-item"><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/ class=post-link>What Is Eco Friendly</a><div>Writing about a solar biochar kiln left me thinking a lot about how to define &ldquo;eco friendly&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve also been thinking about it in relation to some news a friend pointed me at: &ldquo;canvas bags are worse than plastic bags&rdquo;. Poor Tim Minchin.
(I should note: I didn&rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed. I know, I know, I know &ndash; I&rsquo;m part of the problem.</div><a href=https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/ class=more>more...</a></div></div></div></div><div class=footer>Is it clear I have no idea how to make a website?</div></body></html>
