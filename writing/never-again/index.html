We will put rules and processes in place to ensure that this Can&rsquo;t Happen.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect that the side effects of these rules and processes may often, maybe even most of the time, be worse for the group than letting the bad thing happen occasionally.</p><p>My intent is to collect a list of examples here, but the clearest example in my head right now is an example of <em>not</em> doing it.</p></div></div><div class=footer>Is it clear I have no idea how to make a website?</div></body></html>
