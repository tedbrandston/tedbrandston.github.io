&lt;p>My impression is that in most organizations there are moments when things happen, the result of those things is bad for the organization or the people in it, and so the organization says: &amp;ldquo;Never Again. We will put rules and processes in place to ensure that this Can&amp;rsquo;t Happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Respect</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/respect/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my time at Neverware I took a turn that has the director of engineering, and it really changed how I thought about the word &amp;ldquo;respect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Folks on the leadership team used it pretty regularly, and at some point I took issue with it. The connotation I had for respect at that point (especially in a business setting) was &amp;ldquo;deference to authority&amp;rdquo;, and it sounded to me like what was being asked for was compliance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sandy's Roasted Veggies</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/sandys-veggies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/sandys-veggies/</guid><description>At some point I was chatting with my neighbor, Mike, outside his house and caught a whiff of something basily and garlicky that smelled fantastic. I asked about it, and that evening Sandy, his wife &amp;amp; also our neighbor, dropped off a jar of roasted vegetables. They were as good as they smelled, and she gave me an approximate recipe. I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to quite replicate it, but my attempts have been pretty tasty.</description></item><item><title>Solar Biochar at Home</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/solar-biochar-at-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>An idea: solar biochar at home&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while back I read about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar">biochar&lt;/a>. I think it was not-too-long after I attended &lt;a href="https://xiii.hope.net/">HOPE 2020&lt;/a>, and it felt like there were a few ideas floating around that pointed towards diverse, local approaches to climate change (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk&lt;/a> feels associated with this). I think it was also shortly before or after I read &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-alternative-economies-are-inspirations-for-a-sustainable-world/">this article&lt;/a> in Scientific American, plus countless sources/articles looking at how adding carbon to soil can be a good method of carbon sequestration, while also improving crop yields and reducing disease in plants (which means less fertilizer and pesticide).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two Tomato Soups</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/two-tomato-soups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/recipes/two-tomato-soups/</guid><description>The basic framework:
Put some tomatoes in a pot with seasonings Cook until thoroughly softened Lightly strain out the solids (and remove any large pieces of herb), reserving the juice Puree the solids to make a thick tomato soup (or base for pizza sauce) perfect for dunking grilled cheese into Use the juice as a broth for another soup For example: I put onions, garlic, fresh sage, and fresh rosemary, and olive oil in.</description></item><item><title>We don't all interpret words the same ways</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/words/</guid><description>I think the last chapter of Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language by Gretchen McCulloch describes beautifully the way we each have our own, personal version of our languages, and what&amp;rsquo;s captured in the dictionary is more of an aggregate snapshot.
One of my really early memories about this is of watching this comedy routine (I&amp;rsquo;m astonished I was able to find this). Based on the date on that transcript I must have been at least seven or eight years old, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I was older than about twelve.</description></item><item><title>What Is Eco Friendly</title><link>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedbrandston.github.io/writing/what-is-eco-friendly/</guid><description>Writing about a solar biochar kiln left me thinking a lot about how to define &amp;ldquo;eco friendly&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been thinking about it in relation to some news a friend pointed me at: &amp;ldquo;canvas bags are worse than plastic bags&amp;rdquo;. Poor Tim Minchin.
(I should note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t read all of those articles in full, most of them I skimmed. I know, I know, I know &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m part of the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
