# A question about light

I've been struggling for years to get a good mental model of how electromagnetic waves like light and radio waves work. I think a lot of the diagrams I saw as a child misled me, or didn't use good analogies. I feel like I'm getting there, but my current understanding points to what seems like a weird question about how light works.
