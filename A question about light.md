# A question about light

I've been struggling for years to get a good mental model of how electromagnetic waves like light and radio waves work. I think a lot of the diagrams I saw as a child misled me, or didn't use good analogies. I feel like I'm getting there, but my current understanding points to what seems like a weird question about how light works.

## Electromagnetic waves are on a spectrum

Take a look at Wikipedia's article on the [Electromagnetic spectrum] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum), and you'll see that x-rays, red light, and AM radio are all essentially the same thing. The difference is their "wavelength"/"frequency" (and maybe how much energy they carry? I'm not clear on that point.)

Pictures like this show radio waves as squiggly lines of different sizes
