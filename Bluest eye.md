# Bluest eye

I had a moment today where a bunch of things all came together in my head and made a little mesh where they kind of supported each other. It was connecting things I remember thinking about after reading Toni Morrison's The bluest eye in high school with things I've been thinking and reading more recently like how emotions are made by Lisa Feldman-Barrett.

My memory of the blueest eye is that it's about a young girl who ends up going crazy because of the various pressures on her related to race and femininity and poverty. At the end there's a description of her wandering around, completely lost in the world in her head. 

Now I grew up in Manhattan, so seeing people totally lost in what was going on inside their heads, talking themselves or yelling at people who weren't there, was a relatively normal occurrence for me. Not an everyday, or even every week thing, but often enough that the description felt familiar. They were also rarer people who seemed to be angrily talking to themselves because they just had a particularly stressful day. It also felt familiar in that I could see elements of that in myself: every time I remembered something embarrassing I'd said and physically winced or said "stupid!" to myself I was doing a lesser version of that.

I'm not sure if that similarity will feel as self-evident to other people as it does/did to me. That when you are remembering that embarrassing moment You're totally, in your own world. Even if your eyes are open you might not see what's in front of you, you'll see your memory of the embarrassment. And sometimes I even experience that not with memories, but with imagined futures. So when that person on the subway is screaming "You f****** s***heads!" and variations on that at the train tracks I wonder if they aren't just totally immersed in a terrible memory, or imagining a righteous confrontation they'll likely never have.

It all feels part of a continuum of behavior to me.

Many years later I watched a TEDx talk where this guy told us to give ourselves the thumbs up when we had a bad memory.

The idea is basically that you are trying to teach yourself new reaction to these memories. Instead of scolding yourself you signal to your body that everything is okay, you've got it under control.

Now I am Reading how emotions are made, which could probably be titled "How consciousness is made" without being too misleading. A lot of what she says I already had some understanding of, as someone generally interested in psychology and neuroscience: 
* our brains make predictions about the world, a model of what's going on, and we are interacting with that model more than we're interacting with the actual stuff in the world.
* there are more neural pathways headed down from your "higher brain regions" to your sensory organs than from your senses up. There is evidence that your "upper brain" can override what you see, hear, etc.
