# Balancing where my time and attention goes

I've been struggling to find an appropriate balance of where I direct my time and attention. The major division is between restorative/relaxing/recreational time and effortful/productive time. But of course it's never as simple as two categories.

## when and how to relax

The first problem is balancing "rest" and "work". 

Now, while rest usually implies something like putting your feet up and sipping a drink or reading a good book or watching TV, I think it's more complicated than that. Many things can be restful or "restorative" while also being active, many people play casual sports to relax, or weed their gardens.

To do: convert some of these to bullet list?

The last time I tried to nail down what makes an activity count as rest/restorative I said it had to leave me feeling some combination of: energized, like some naps and some walks; inspired, like reading Scientific American or playing certain video games; and/or present, which was actually more defined by its opposite -- sometimes otherwise restful activities leave me unpleasantly up-in-my-head.

For a while I tried to track these three dimensions of My restorative time. By "a while" I mean perhaps a week, it really didn't last long. I do feel like I have noticed another dimension, though maybe this is something that I had thoughtlessly lumped in under energy: there's energy level like sleep pressure, energy level like physically tired, and the new one that feels worth separating out is feeling mentally drained like the act of thinking at all is somewhat distasteful[^1].

so there are a bunch of things that potentially make an activity feel restorative in some way. indifferent activities will make sense depending on the specific way in which I feel depleted. but I value long-term productive use of my time, so if I can choose among restorative activities I should be choosing The ones that are long-term productive.

as an example: playing certain video games can leave me feeling less mentally drained, and sometimes inspired, but they can leave me feeling unpresent and I don't think it's a long-term productive use of my time. programming can give me the same feeling of accomplishment and learning a new system that playing GameStop, and feels like it is absolutely more productive both short and long term.

so that covers at least part of when to relax (when I'm feeling various kinds of depleted) and how to relax


I don't know where this other thing fits in: 

Okay, actually, I think the question that I'm coming around to is: is is it actually just that I've been confusing a reluctance to work on something with feeling depleted? with _being_ depleted and needing a rest?



[^1]: it also feels worth calling out, if only for myself, that this feeling of being mentally drained is distinct from the feeling of resistance to starting a difficult or uncertain task that I sometimes struggle with.
