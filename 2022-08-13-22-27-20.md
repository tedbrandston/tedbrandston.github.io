# Anonymity

Another significant Neverware memory is going over the company survey results. It was considered pretty important by most people that the submissions remain anonymous. A lot of the time that seemed fine, but sometimes it made very hard to make useful changes.

Anonymity can be pretty hard to achieve in the first place in small communities (Neverware was only 25 to 30 people when I was in a position to help evaluate the company survey). There's the classic issue of speaking up about your boss when you're one of only two people reporting to them, or complaining about something that everyone knows only affects you.

Still, I think it can be a great way to help surface issues that people would otherwise be uncomfortable bringing up. Not everyone might be comfortable attaching their name when they say "I don't think I'm getting paid enough", there's a bit of a social risk (and in some companies an employment risk) involved in speaking up about compensation. But when a bunch of people speak up about it anonymously, it can indicate to management that this needs to be addressed.

Now, sometimes you just get one anonymous voice pointing out an issue, or a small number of extreme outliers on your 5-point scale. ...

The real problem with anonymity comes in when the lone commenter on a topic is insufficiently clear on what the issue is. This might not be their fault or yours, it might just be that you don't have the context to understand what they're frustrated by.
