# Adulting

It doesn't happen so much anymore, but I remember about 5 years ago a lot of people my age were talking about how they weren't very good at "adulting". This meant, roughly, that they felt like they didn't handle certain things like they felt an adult should, in spite of being old enough to be considered an adult (say somewhere in the 23- to 27-year-old range).

I also felt that I was not great at adulting. In some ways I feel what I still am not. But but where does this come from? Do we think that our parents were more capable than us at the same age? Who are we comparing ourselves to? Why are we comparing ourselves at all?

I think there's actually a lot of pieces to this.

I think that we have the impression that our parents' generation was more adept at doing the tasks associated with adulthood when they were our age. I actually think that impression is likely correct for people in my social milieu. My mom started working in an accounting office at age 14. My father-in-law moved out of his parents place at age 18 (or was it 16?). 

Us middle-class kids in the 2000's were expected to do a lot of school and after school and standardized test-related stuff, but not contribute to the house much. We did some chores, sure, but I feel like my parents' generation had more exposure
