# What does it mean to be human?

An article that I was reading today in scientific American made me revisit for a bit the old college question "what does it mean to be human?"

<!--more-->

This was one of the three questions at the core of Ursinus college's "common intellectual experience", alongside "what is our place in the universe?" And "How should we live our lives?".

The article, which I won't link, was one of those things where someone very knowledgeable about one subject is asked to weigh in on broader philosophical questions, and their answer is end up lacking... Something. Some nuance or broader understanding. 

But because _How emotions are made_ by Lisa Feldman Barrett is changing the way I think about pretty much everything I found myself thinking about the "concept" of "human". I'm not sure that I've actually been thinking anything _particularly_ new, since it all basically boils down to "seems like people come up with definitions for human based on what they think humans should be" and I remember thinking about that back in 2008 as I watched a lecturer argue that complex language is what makes us human: "only humans can say 'buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo'!". Still, within the context of "concepts" as a thing our brain does, it felt different in my head.

So, in HEAM, Lisa describes our brains as being good at creating "concepts": goal-oriented groupings of things that are similar in some way, even if that similarity is just "someone used the same word for these". She says that we use concepts for pretty much everything, our brain is constantly categorizing everything we see, hear, etc. (Including sensations from our body) based on our set of concepts.

So, what is your concept for "human"?

Not just the image that might pop into your head, but all of what makes you categorize something as human versus not.

Actually, I'm not sure that this is right. Whatever in above drops the distinction between "How do we define human?" And "what does it mean to be human?". The question in the article I read was actually more like "what is it about our brains that makes us human?" Which assumes that our brains are part of what makes us human (I happen to agree, but it feels like an assumption worth pointing out).

Not sure that I need to finish writing this...
